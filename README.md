## Installation 

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Usage
You will need to run the client and server seperately unless a script is added to run both at the same time. If a production build is ran on the front end and the build folder is placed in the server directory, the site you should be able to run the site on the backend alone. Requires a mongo database to persist data.
